# Claude Code companion plugins

Four self-contained [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugins that let you
**vibe-code a whole project** while Claude keeps it clean, low-debt, and token-efficient
— **automatically, through hooks** — with the native task list as the one place you
steer. Built for an owner who reads no code and *need never run a command* — though a
few optional `/task-queue:` commands give deterministic control when you want it.

## The flow

```
 ▐▌ always on   native permissions (auto · deny/ask) · hud status line (●health ✓tests ❓open-Qs ctx%)

 ● SessionStart   charter: gate on docs+decisions+scar-tissue · task-queue: queue policy+resume · tidy: standard

> Run `./flow.sh` (or `make flow`) for the **live, colored** version — derived from the

## The four plugins

| Plugin | Ver | Role | Highlights |
|---|---|---|---|
| **task-queue** | 0.33.0 | Orchestrate | review loop on every prompt (steelman→challenge critique) · wireframe design preview · intent→outcome gate · open-questions tracker · cross-session resume + mid-task breadcrumb · **autopilot** (enforced autonomy — auto-continues the queue, blocks asking, parks decisions) · crash-checkpoint (working-tree snapshots) · per-feature slash commands (`/task-queue:autopilot` · `checkpoint` · `agents` · `restore` · `status`) |
| **tidy** | 0.39.0 | Change safely | secret floor (block credentials pre-write) · format/lint on touch · blast-radius · verification floor · regression gate · quality floor · import-cycle check · auto-prune |
| **charter** | 0.20.1 | Know the project | doc & decisions gate · alignment floor · outcome-memory "scar tissue" · conventions · owner loop · MCP reachability probe |
| **hud** | 0.9.1 | Show | one read-only status line — health · always-on feature status (✈️ autopilot/🧷 checkpoint/🤖 agents) · tests · floors-off · open-Qs · tok · branch (+unpushed) · model (`/hud:legend` decodes every symbol) |

Each plugin is independently installable · Bash + `jq` · zero build.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add andrewstanbury/claude-task-queue
/plugin install task-queue@andrewstanbury tidy@andrewstanbury charter@andrewstanbury hud@andrewstanbury
```

Or run `/plugin` and pick them from the **Discover** tab.

## Design

**Hooks-first** (no MCP, no skills), **token-efficient by construction** — near-zero at
rest, cost proportional to the work. Design record:
