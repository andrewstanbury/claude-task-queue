# ROADMAP — the vibe-coding companion system

A living **design record**: the direction, the durable decisions, and what's next.
Per-version history lives in git, not here (the human-facing CHANGELOG was removed
in the 2026-06-16 redesign — git history has the detail). Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the conventions
and hard invariants that constrain everything below.

The goal: a set of Claude Code plugins that let you **vibe-code an entire project**
while Claude keeps it clean, well-documented, token-efficient, and low-debt —
**proactively, with minimal input**, entirely through the CLI. The owner reads no
code, no docs, and runs no commands; the system is automatic and artifact-free
(only **lean Claude-context** files, never human-facing prose). *Two sanctioned
human-facing surfaces (owner-requested):* (1) `flow.sh` at the repo root (`./flow.sh`
/ `make flow`) renders an at-a-glance colored workflow diagram in the terminal — in
the hand-drawn visual format, but **derived live** from the repo (hook wiring, the
review-loop steps, versions, permission state) so it can't drift; and (2) a lean
`README.md` for **GitHub discoverability** — a *different audience* than the
artifact-free principle addresses (repo visitors deciding whether to install, not the
owner operating the system). The README is deliberately high-level (what it is, the
flow, the 4 plugins, install) so it ages slowly, and points at `flow.sh` for the live
flow. Keep both; don't prune them. *(2026-06-17: README re-added — the original
redesign deleted it as an owner-workflow doc; this restores it for discoverability,
which that decision didn't contemplate.)*

## Prioritized criteria (in order)

Tuned for **existing, often legacy, under-tested projects that must stay clean as
they grow.** The forces that contain debt lead; the intent loop and payoff follow.

- **0 · Keep the project self-describing** *(precondition)* — a project map
  (file→responsibility, for blast radius), recorded decisions/ADRs, quality
  attributes, stack notes. Bootstrap if missing; gate substantive work on it. Kept
  as **lean Claude-context** files (charter authors them), not human docs.
- **1 · Contain blast radius** — know what a change ripples into (code +
  architectural) and cover it; one owner per concern; watch total coupling. **YAGNI:
  the burden of proof is on *adding* a dep/abstraction/layer.**
- **2 · Verify + stay aligned** — confirm intent in plain language; characterize
  before you change (no tests → pin current behaviour first); suite green before
  done (the verification floor); weigh work against recorded decisions (clean ≠
  correct); honor the owner's *outcome*, not their proposed implementation.
- **3 · Subtract as you add** — a new requirement leaves net surface flat or
  smaller; reuse before create, delete what a change makes redundant.
- **4 · Periodic deliberate prune** — for the cross-module debt touch-time bounding
  skips; now **automatic** (fires on a debt threshold, see tidy below).

**Payoff — token efficiency:** not *fewest* tokens but *highest-leverage* ones. A
well-mapped, small-filed, clean project is automatically cheap for Claude to load
and reason about. It accrues from 0–4; don't chase it directly. **Enforced as an
NFR:** `tests/token-budget.bats` runs each hook in its representative path and fails
CI if its injected text exceeds a per-hook **character budget** (~4 chars/token) —
recurring injections (SessionStart steady-state, per-prompt) budgeted tightest,
per-event Stop blocks given more room. Growing a budget is a deliberate ratchet
(bump the number in the same change). So the system's defining quality attribute
can't silently regress.

## Architecture — four self-contained plugins

| Plugin | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **task-queue** | **Orchestrate** — the interpret→present→approve review loop, capture, order, cross-session resume, pause (gates the loop), the Stop-time intent→outcome gate (loop close) |
| **tidy** | **Change safely & cleanly** — format/lint on touch, blast-radius, verification floor, automatic prune |
| **charter** | **Know the project + own the owner loop** — doc gate, map, decisions anchor (+ Stop-time alignment floor), conventions, outcome memory, intent→demo→consent posture |
| **hud** | **Show** — a consolidated read-only status line (the owner's at-a-glance trust signal) |

Each plugin stays independently installable (the install boundary forbids shared
code — see AGENTS.md), Bash + `jq`, zero build, locality over decomposition.

## What each plugin does now

- **task-queue** — SessionStart policy (native task list = live queue) +
  cross-session **resume bridge** (the native list starts empty each session; this
  re-surfaces a repo's unfinished tasks — the system's confirmed native gap) +
  per-repo pause + opt-in agent-mode + roadmap hydration + schema-drift canary.
  (Moving down the queue is left to Claude Code's native task nudges.) Its
  centerpiece is the **interpret→present→approve review loop**: on any substantive
  prompt (multi-step OR consequential) the capture hook has the model interpret the
  request, decompose it, judge each task for risk/alignment and parallel-vs-inline
  fan-out, **present its understanding + candid per-task recommendations (incl. skip)
  via AskUserQuestion**, and TaskCreate only what the user approves — weighed against
  recorded direction. Trivial prompts stay silent. **Pause** suppresses the review
  loop so substantive prompts run straight through in auto. On a **visual/design**
  prompt the loop specializes into a **design preview**: the model presents a
  recommended design + 2-3 alternatives as faithful **ASCII mockups** in the
  AskUserQuestion `preview` (native keyboard-nav + Enter, recommended first), and
  builds only the chosen one — the owner-loop's "demonstrate" moved *ahead* of the
  work (a non-technical owner verifies by seeing, not by reading code). Detected by
  a precision-tuned heuristic (visual intent + UI noun; architecture/API "design"
  and functional edits don't trip it). Fires even on a short single-sentence ask. On Stop, the
  **intent→outcome gate** closes the loop: the substantive prompt's plain-language
  ask is stashed at capture time (the *intent of record*) and replayed at "done"
  against the actual diff — blocking **once** (consumed per ask, so it can't loop)
  so the model verifies the OUTCOME matches the request and recaps in plain language,
  surfacing "built the wrong thing / only part / something extra" to the non-technical
  owner before declaring done. `CLAUDE_TQ_INTENT_GATE=0` disables it; pause suppresses
  capture too. **Open-questions tracker:** answer-owed questions the model leaves
  hanging are recorded as native `❓` tasks; the capture hook re-surfaces any
  unanswered one on the **next** prompt (even a trivial/paused one — a new prompt is
  exactly when they get buried), and **hud** shows an ambient `❓N` count so they get
  *noticed* without anyone re-raising them. Model-assisted recording (it judges which
  questions are answer-worthy; the hooks make them persistent + visible);
  `CLAUDE_TQ_OPEN_Q=0` disables. hud's count is a drift-guarded mirror of
  `tq_open_questions`.
- **tidy** — **before** a write (PreToolUse): the **secret floor** — scan the content
  a write would land for hardcoded credentials (prefix-anchored shapes + a
  placeholder-filtered generic pattern, pure regex so it works without gitleaks) and
  **block before it reaches disk**; tidy's one deliberate hard-stop, everything else
  fails open (`CLAUDE_TIDY_SECSCAN=0` disables). On touch: format + lint
  (Go/web/Python/shell, fast file-scoped tools) + blast-radius + coverage/size nudges.
  On Stop: the **verification floor**
  (run the project's tests, block until green, bounded); the **quality floor**
  (before the tests, run the project's OWN declared typecheck/a11y/dep-rule gates —
  detect-and-run package.json scripts, install/invent nothing, heavy Lighthouse/CWV
  audits stay in CI — block until green, bounded; `CLAUDE_TIDY_QUALITY_FLOOR=0` to
  disable); the **import-cycle check** (madge, post-green, surface cycles touching the
  change); the **coupling-density trend** (nudge when import-edges-per-file — a
  size-normalized proxy, so healthy growth doesn't false-alarm — climbs past a
  threshold vs the last check; per-repo baseline, `CLAUDE_TIDY_COUPLING_TREND=0` to
  disable); the **regression gate**
  (block when a changed file is BOTH a scar-tissue hotspot — repeatedly fixed, by
  the same rework-ratio detector charter uses, mirrored + drift-guarded — AND still
  untested, so a fix to a proven debt-magnet gets pinned before it can silently
  regress; default-on but narrow, quiet once a test lands, `CLAUDE_TIDY_REGRESSION_GATE=0`
  to disable); and — only after a clean verify on a dirty tree — the **deliberate
  prune** when over-budget files cross a
  threshold (`CLAUDE_TIDY_PRUNE_THRESHOLD`, default 3): a weight report
  (`tidy-distill.sh`) + an instruction to prune now, as a **non-blocking
  systemMessage throttled once per debt episode** (re-fires only after debt drops
  below the threshold and re-crosses), routing cuts through the task-queue loop.
  Firing post-turn keeps it from derailing the user's intent. SessionStart no longer
  surfaces whole-project debt; the per-touch size nudge covers reactive size. No
  slash commands.
- **charter** — at SessionStart, a compact **proportional brief** gating substantive
  work on the project's Claude manual (quality attributes, map, decisions anchor,
  roadmap, stack, established conventions), detect-not-author, quiet once summarised
  in CLAUDE.md. Also surfaces **outcome memory ("scar tissue")** — files the project
  has *repeatedly had to FIX*, derived from git history by the **rework ratio**
  (fix/revert commits ÷ total commits touching a file ≥ 0.34, min 2 reworks, existing
  files only), not raw churn — so the review loop treats debt magnets as high-risk
  before extending them. State, not policy: surfaced even in quiet mode, silent on a
  clean/new repo. Owns the **owner loop** (confirm intent → demonstrate → recap).
  On Stop, the **alignment floor**: when a finished change plausibly bears on a
  recorded decision (a dependency manifest / config / migration changed, or a
  backtick-fenced decision token appears in the diff — a cheap deterministic
  pre-filter that stays silent on routine edits), it blocks **once** and puts the
  recorded decisions in front of the model — honor them, or, on a reversal, surface
  it to the owner in plain language and confirm before it lands. Bounded like tidy's
  test floor (per-tree throttle + `CLAUDE_CHARTER_ALIGN_MAX` cap, never loops);
  `CLAUDE_CHARTER_ALIGN_GATE=0` disables it. This is the **outcome-time** complement
  to the review loop's **intent-time** alignment — alignment is now checked at both
  ends. On demand: `/charter:align`. Action-time consent is native (see below) —
  charter carries only the standing posture, no hook. A second SessionStart hook is
  the **MCP reachability probe**: it reads the MCP servers *declared* for the repo
  (merged from `~/.claude.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings*.json`) and checks
  each actually responds — a bounded, parallel `initialize` handshake to stdio
  servers and a POST to http/sse endpoints — so the silent failure mode (a
  mis-installed/unreachable server whose tools just never appear) is surfaced to a
  non-technical owner in plain language. An HTTP auth challenge counts as reachable;
  only a fresh start probes (not compact/resume); self-disables when no servers are
  declared; never blocks; `CLAUDE_CHARTER_MCP_PROBE=0` disables it.
- **hud** — a static health beacon + paused + agent + the verification floor's ✓/✗
  tests + context-window fill % + branch & dirty + model. Read-only, zero token cost.
  With no logs or docs to read, this beacon is the owner's primary trust signal.

## Durable design decisions

- **Native-first.** Where Claude Code does it natively, use the native mechanism and
  don't reimplement: the native **task list** (the queue), native **permissions /
  `auto` mode** (safe autonomy + destructive-action gating), native **statusLine**
  (hud), native **AskUserQuestion** (the present-before-queue interaction), native
  **subagents** (agent-mode fan-out). Hooks earn their keep only where they *execute*
  on an event or read state a session can't see.
- **Run in auto.** The user's `~/.claude/settings.json` sets
  `permissions.defaultMode: "auto"` (auto-approve **with background safety checks**)
  plus a hard-block `deny` set (`rm -rf /` and `~`) and an `ask` set (force-push,
  `reset --hard`). This is the safe-autonomy posture the owner asked for.
- **Proportionality over maximalism** — every practice scaled to complexity/risk.
- **Verification + simplicity over methodology labels** — tests as a safety net (the
  floor), SOLID's essence, DDD's ubiquitous language, **YAGNI**, boring & reversible.
  The decision: encode these as **concrete generation-time rules** (no-seam,
  deletion-test, unit-cohesion, complexity-altitude — stated in CLAUDE.md's working
  standards and the tidy SessionStart standard), **not** as methodology labels, since
  a "SOLID checker" isn't mechanically viable. The test-fail block's **diagnose loop**
  composes with the regression gate.
- **Non-technical-owner posture** — autonomy on the reversible, plain-language
  consent on the consequential (the line is reversibility + cost + data-safety).
  Verification must be **observable** (demo it working; the owner verifies by seeing,
  not by reading tests or docs).
- **Subtractive force + quiet hooks** — bootstrap-once (policy in CLAUDE.md, marked
  `claude-companion`) then re-anchor in one line; state (carry-over, drift) is never
  suppressed, only policy prose.
- **Clean ≠ correct** — route charter's decisions/roadmap into the loop so new work
  is weighed against recorded direction before it lands.
- **Critique posture: selective, substantive-gated, bidirectional, self-challengeable**
  (2026-06-19) — the review loop EVALUATES before executing (steelman → challenge →
  recommend-against when warranted), challenging **both** the project's recorded
  constraints *and* the owner's own accumulated requirements/bias when they contradict
  or force a poor/over-engineered design. **Not on every prompt** — only the
  substantive/consequential gate: mandated on-everything critique becomes theater and
  *false pushback trains rubber-stamping*, and per-prompt critique on trivial work
  breaks the zero-cost invariant. Claims only what's feasible (contradiction +
  named-anti-pattern detection; **not** general "bias" — no reference frame). Shipped
  in task-queue's existing UserPromptSubmit injection (no new hook/plugin).
  **Deferred** until the gap proves real (a YAGNI call): bidirectional charter
  alignment (challenge a standing decision, not just protect it) and an on-demand
  `/charter:challenge` audit. The mandate stays **challengeable** — "always question my
  requirements" must not become the one requirement never questioned.

## Decided against

- **Consolidating the 4 plugins into 1** (2026-05-31; **reaffirmed 2026-06-16**) —
  after the redesign's deletions the duplication is small; consolidation is deferred
  ("delete first, then judge"). Revisit only if it bites.
- **A charter doc-inventory state file** (2026-06-01) — the install boundary forces a
  fallback detector anyway, so it's net-additive. Chose the CI drift-guard test.
- **A hard, plugin-owned destructive-action *gate*** — a plugin can't own a reliable
  block. **Superseded 2026-06-16:** the gating is now **native** (`permissions.deny`/
  `ask` + `auto`-mode safety checks), which *is* harness-enforced — this also retired
  charter's fragile 2026-06-01 PreToolUse consent regex (it false-fired on `rm -rf`
  substrings in unrelated commands and only reminded; charter keeps the plain-language
  consent *posture*). **Narrow exception (2026-06-21):** tidy's PreToolUse **secret floor** does
  block a write — the one place a plugin gate earns its keep, because native
  permissions scan bash *commands*/code *style* but nothing scans file *content* an
  agent writes for committed credentials, and a leaked key is irreversible. Kept
  high-precision (prefix-anchored) so false blocks stay near-zero. This is the single
  concept imported from `SPEC.md` (claude-governance's T3 obligations); its audit
  log, tier vocabulary, approver chains, and CI floor stay out (org-compliance
  machinery, not this system's single-owner bet).
- **Native plan mode for the present-before-work step** (2026-06-16) — rejected in
  favour of the task-queue's interpret→present→approve loop: plan mode is read-only
  and all-or-nothing per session, whereas the owner wants to run in auto and review
  only the *queue interpretation*. The loop is that, owned by task-queue.
- **One single CLAUDE.md as the only doc** (2026-06-16) — would conflict with
  charter's separate-file detection (it would nag "missing map/roadmap" every
  session). Chose **a few lean Claude-context files** (CLAUDE.md + map + decisions +
  per-plugin CONTRACTs); charter's model is unchanged.

## Anti-rework floors (the prevention taxonomy)

A taxonomy of rework causes, each closed by a **bounded, disable-able,
detect-not-decide Stop-time floor** (the hook supplies facts; the model judges):

| Open loop (cause of future rework) | Closed by | Disable |
|---|---|---|
| Tests red at "done" | tidy verification floor | `CLAUDE_TIDY_CHECKS=0` |
| Regression of a repeatedly-fixed file | tidy regression gate (← charter scar tissue) | `CLAUDE_TIDY_REGRESSION_GATE=0` |
| Silent reversal of a recorded decision | charter alignment floor | `CLAUDE_CHARTER_ALIGN_GATE=0` |
| Built ≠ what the owner asked | task-queue intent→outcome gate | `CLAUDE_TQ_INTENT_GATE=0` |

Durable decisions behind the table (blow-by-blow in git; detail in each CONTRACT):

- **Outcome memory is charter's, prevention is the verifiers'.** charter *detects*
  scar tissue — `charter_hotspots` flags files by the **rework ratio** (fix/revert ÷
  total touching a file ≥ 0.34, ≥ 2 reworks, existing files), the *disease* not raw
  churn, surfaced at SessionStart; tidy's regression gate then *prevents* recurrence
  (a changed file that's both a hotspot and untested must be pinned before "done").
- **Alignment is verified at both ends** — intent-time (the review loop weighs new
  work against recorded direction) and outcome-time (charter's align gate on the diff;
  task-queue's intent gate on the captured ask vs. the diffstat).
- **Cheap pre-filters keep the gates quiet** — escalate only on decision-bearing
  surfaces (deps/config/migrations), fenced-token overlap, or the hotspot subset.
  Precision over recall: a false block is noise.
- **Loop-proof + small-footprint** — each gate bounds itself (per-tree/per-ask consume
  or a per-session cap) and writes cache-only state, never the project.
- **YAGNI held** — the broader "a *tested* hotspot's fix should add a new case" tier
  was deliberately not built (over-nags). Further work is demand-driven.

## What's next

Demand-driven only — a new stack to lint, a real owner-not-at-the-terminal scenario
(the one place an MCP integration, e.g. emailing the owner a plain-language recap,
would earn its keep), or a pain point that surfaces. No new layers planned.
