# MAP — where things live

A compact `file → responsibility` index. Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for conventions and
[docs/ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for direction. The 2026-07-11 rebuild (R24) collapsed the old
four plugins into one; this reflects the current tree.

## Repo root

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | What this repo is + hard constraints + pointer to the steering doc. |
| `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` | The **requirements ledger** — durable requirements/decisions with 🔒/🔓/⚰️ status. Source of truth. |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | Direction and backlog. |
| `docs/MAP.md` | This file. |
| `check.sh` | One-command gate: JSON valid · `claude plugin validate` · ShellCheck · secret scan · 300-line size guard · bats. CI runs this. |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Marketplace manifest (the one `companion` plugin). |

## plugins/companion — the whole system

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `STEERING.md` | **The steering layer** — the working agreement (queue discipline · challenge-the-ask + recommendation posture against the ledger · clean-as-you-go · autopilot). Prose the model reads once per session; not code, not a hook. |
| `bin/session-start.sh` | SessionStart hook: inject STEERING once + re-surface this repo's open tasks from an earlier session (scoped by each session store's `.root` stamp — no native transcript, no cross-repo bleed) + surface the repo's `docs/LESSONS.md` gotchas if present (R30·d7). Fires on `source=compact` too → **re-anchors after a context compaction** (R30·d2), with a compaction-aware lead. |
| `bin/pre-compact.sh` | PreCompact hook (R30·d2): before the context is summarized, nudge the model to freshen the in-progress task's breadcrumb + done-when (the queue is its memory across the compaction). Best-effort; the reliable re-anchor is the SessionStart side. |
| `bin/secret-guard.sh` | PreToolUse[Write\|Edit] hook: the one **enforced** content-gate — block a write that would commit a credential (`exit 2`). `CLAUDE_COMPANION_SECSCAN=0` disables. |
| `bin/touch.sh` | PostToolUse[Write\|Edit] hook: **clean-as-you-touch, format-only** — prefer the project's own `pre-commit` on the file if configured, else the per-ext formatter (which reads the project's config; black-vs-ruff honored from pyproject) — R30·d4. Behavior-preserving, non-blocking, emits nothing. Blast-radius + size are steering (R28). `CLAUDE_COMPANION_TOUCH=0` disables. |
| `docs/LESSONS.md` | This repo's accumulated **gotchas** (portability/test/CI traps) — model-maintained, injected each session by `session-start.sh` (R30·d7). Gotchas only; decisions live in the ledger, work in the queue. |
| `commands/audit.md` | `/companion:audit` — on-demand whole-project sweep via a **sub-agent panel** (size / debt / blast-radius / perf, one lens each → synthesize → queue), R30·d5. Read-only; queues fixes via `tq`, doesn't sweep. |
| `commands/advise.md` | `/companion:advise` (R29) — independent brutal-honest critique of a target (default: whole project) via a critic panel; presents deltas as recommendation-first `AskUserQuestion`s one at a time, then closes the loop into `tq` + an offered ledger entry. |
| `bin/tq` | **THE task queue** — the companion owns its store (`~/.claude/companion/tasks`, NOT native tasks). `add [--done "<acceptance>"]`/`doing`/`note`/`done-when`/`done`/`list`/`report`; a task's `done_when` (R30·d1) is its acceptance test, rendered in the report + resume so it survives a compaction. Report reprints on every state change. |
| `bin/resume.sh` | Manual resume (`/companion:resume`) — list this repo's open tasks from earlier sessions on demand (the SessionStart twin). |
| `commands/ship-it.md` | `/companion:ship-it` — verify → **state the case** (risks / what-changes / R-IDs; devil's-advocate sub-agent for consequential changes, R30·d6) → commit → push → PR/merge to the default branch. |
| `commands/resume.md` | `/companion:resume` — re-surface + reinstate earlier open tasks. |
| `bin/statusline.sh` | The status line (a `statusLine` command, not a hook): ⠋ animated beacon · 🛡 secret gate · model · ✈️ autopilot · ⇡in ⇣out tokens · ◻ open · ❓ parked · ⏳ blocked tasks · project · branch (+ ↑ahead ↓behind). Read-only, no model cost; the beacon animates at `refreshInterval:1` (waking jq+git once/sec on idle). Wire with `/companion:setup`. |
| `bin/autopilot.sh` | Toggle the persisted per-repo autopilot flag (`on`/`off`/`status`). |
| `bin/stop-autopilot.sh` | Stop hook: while autopilot is on and non-deferred work remains, auto-continue the drain (no-progress capped); yields when only ❓/⏳ remain. `CLAUDE_COMPANION_AUTOPILOT_CONTINUE=0` disables. |
| `bin/ask-guard.sh` | PreToolUse[AskUserQuestion] hook: deny asking while autopilot is on (decide-if-reversible or park as ❓). Silent when autopilot is off. |
| `lib/companion.sh` | Shared helpers (flag encoding/paths, repo root, open-task scan) — sourced by autopilot, the Stop hook, ask-guard, session-start/resume, and the status line, so the encoding can't drift. |
| `commands/setup.md` · `commands/autopilot.md` | `/companion:setup` (status line) · `/companion:autopilot` (toggle). |
| `hooks/hooks.json` | Wires SessionStart · PreToolUse[Write\|Edit (secret-guard) + AskUserQuestion (ask-guard)] · PostToolUse[Write\|Edit (touch)] · Stop (stop-autopilot) · PreCompact (pre-compact). |
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Manifest + version. |
| `tests/companion-{core,hud,fuzz}.bats` | Test the **enforced core only** — `core` (secret gate · `tq` · session-start/resume · touch · autopilot), `hud` (status line), `fuzz` (every hook survives empty/garbage/huge/emoji stdin — R30·d8). The steering layer is prose; it isn't unit-testable, and pretending it was is what the old system got wrong. |
