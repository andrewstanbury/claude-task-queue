# Changelog

Notable changes. Per-change detail lives in `git log`; this file keeps the headlines.

## companion 1.6.0 — 2026-07-12

- **`/companion:advise`** (ledger R29) — an independent, brutally-honest critique ritual. Takes a
  target (file / subsystem / decision / topic; default: the whole project), spawns a critic
  **panel** with distinct lenses so the critique comes from contexts that didn't build the thing,
  and presents each recommended change as a **recommendation-first `AskUserQuestion`, one at a
  time**; then closes the loop into `tq` + an offered ledger entry. Every critic may conclude "no
  change" — a manufactured delta is the fake pushback the steering doc forbids. Operationalizes
  the R5/R17 challenge posture as an on-demand command; owner-present (blocked under autopilot).

## companion 1.5.0 — 2026-07-12

- **Status bar redesign** — the single `📋 N` count split into `◻ open · ❓ parked · ⏳ blocked`,
  plus git `↑ahead ↓behind`. The parked-task scan behind it is now a single `jq` pass (~18×
  faster; it runs every second).
- **Architecture realignment (ledger R28)** — the hook/steering boundary is now decided by a
  component's *nature*: code only for what must **execute** (the formatter) or **block** (the
  secret gate), plus autopilot's control-flow guarantee — **judgment and nudges are steering.**
  This **retired the R27 edit-gates** (design-preview + return-review) and the intent→outcome
  reminder; `touch.sh` is now **format-only** (blast-radius + size → steering, R25 reshaped).
  Deleted `work-guard.sh`, `prompt.sh`, `intent-note.sh`; retired `CLAUDE_COMPANION_GATES` and
  `CLAUDE_COMPANION_SIZE_BUDGET`.
- Tests split into `companion-core.bats` / `companion-hud.bats`. CI hardening folded in from
  1.4.x (git identity in tests, jq broken-pipe, macOS bash-3.2 status-line crash).

## companion 1.4.0 — 2026-07-12

- **Animated status line** — a braille-orbit health beacon (`refreshInterval:1`), `│ 🛡 │`
  spacing fix, consolidated off the deprecated `hud` plugin onto `companion`. (Kept in 1.5.0.)
- **R27 edit-gates** (design-preview + return-review blocks, intent→outcome reminder) + 🎨/🔒
  status icons — **retired one day later in 1.5.0 (R28)** as the wrong side of the hook/steering
  line. `author` field added; macOS + CI hardening (1.4.1–1.4.2).

## companion 1.3.0 — 2026-07-12

- **`/companion:ship-it`** — verify the project's gate → commit → push → PR/merge to the
  default branch. Codifies the ship flow.
- **`/companion:resume`** + `bin/resume.sh` — manually re-surface this repo's unfinished tasks
  from an earlier session (the on-demand twin of the automatic SessionStart resume).
- Internal: the shared `lib/companion.sh` (renamed from `lib/autopilot.sh`) now holds the
  cross-session open-tasks helper, used by both SessionStart and manual resume.
- First step of "restore features onto the one-plugin spine" — the removed commands other than
  these two stay gone by owner choice.

## companion 1.2.0 — 2026-07-11

- **Autopilot is enforced + persisted** (ledger R26). `/companion:autopilot on|off` sets a
  per-repo flag that survives restarts; while on, the Stop hook auto-continues the queue (until
  only parked ❓/⏳ remain, no-progress capped) and a PreToolUse guard blocks `AskUserQuestion`.
  The status line shows ✈️. Env: `CLAUDE_COMPANION_AUTOPILOT_CONTINUE`, `_MAX`, `_STATE_DIR`.
- **Design-preview restored** to the steering doc: the full wireframe convention
  (`╔═╗` container, `▒` input, `█` primary, recommended-first) — steering-only, no gate.
- (These closed the two advisory-only gaps from the post-rebuild capability review.)

## companion 1.1.0 — 2026-07-11

- **Clean-as-you-touch** (`bin/touch.sh`, PostToolUse): after you edit a file, format it with
  the project's own formatter, surface its blast radius (dependents), and flag it if it's over
  the size budget. Non-blocking; `CLAUDE_COMPANION_TOUCH=0` disables, `CLAUDE_COMPANION_SIZE_BUDGET`
  tunes size. A conscious partial-reversal of the rebuild's austerity (ledger R25).
- **`/companion:audit`** — on-demand whole-project sweep (size / debt / blast-radius hotspots),
  queues the fixes via `tq`.
- The task queue is now fully self-owned (its own store, not native tasks), reprints on every
  state change, and a minimal status line returned. (Rolled up from the same day.)

## companion 1.0.0 — 2026-07-11

**Ground-up rebuild.** The four plugins (`task-queue`, `tidy`, `charter`, `hud`) were
replaced by one plugin, **`companion`**, built on a single principle: *steering is a
document, enforcement is code, never confuse the two.*

- **Steering** — all the prose that shapes how Claude works (task queue, the brutal-honest
  recommendation posture against the requirements ledger, clean-as-you-go, autopilot) now
  lives in one file, `plugins/companion/STEERING.md`, put in context once per session.
- **Enforced core** — the only behavior that must execute or block, kept as code: a pre-write
  secret gate (`secret-guard.sh`), cross-session task resume (`session-start.sh`), and the
  `tq` queue fallback for models with the native task tools gated off.
- **Retired**: the per-hook token-budget NFR, the cross-plugin drift-guard and mirrored
  detectors, the status line (`hud`), and every advisory Stop/PreToolUse prose-hook.
- ~12,500 lines → a few hundred. Rationale and reshaped requirements: `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`
  (R24).

## Before 1.0.0

The four-plugin history (task-queue / tidy / charter / hud, versioned independently through
mid-2026) is in `git log` — the commit messages carry the same detail this file used to.
