# hud — a consolidated status line for the companion plugins. One line, rendered
# from the JSON Claude Code pipes to a statusLine command on stdin plus the
# read-only state the sibling plugins maintain. No model calls, no hooks, no
# writes — it only reads and prints, so it can't interfere with anything.
#
# Three zones joined by a dim │ divider; empty slots (and empty zones) collapse:
#   [ ● health · 🛡 safety(✗N off) · ✓/✗ tests · 🎨 design-gate · 🔒 review-gate · ❓ decisions · ⏳ owner-blocked ]
#   [ ✈️ autopilot · 🤖 agents  (green on, grey off) ]
#   [ model · tok ⇡in ⇣out · ⎇ branch (+ dirty * · ↑ahead ↓behind) ]
# Decode any symbol on demand with /hud:legend.
#
# Scoped to signals a status line is the BEST surface for — persistent
# state/health you want at a glance. Deliberately NOT re-rendered here: the task
# list (Claude Code shows it natively), docs-health (charter nudges it at session
# start), and last-tidy (ephemeral) — surfacing those again was duplication, and
# the docs mirror was the heaviest cross-plugin maintenance burden.
#
# The beacon is an ANIMATED braille-orbit spinner (green = clean/green, yellow = solo
# mode, red = tests failing), advancing one frame per real second. That needs a timer,
# so hud-install.sh sets refreshInterval=1 in the statusLine config; Claude Code re-runs
# this command every second (plus its event-driven refreshes on each message / after
# compact), which both animates the beacon AND keeps every other slot fresh. The cost is
# waking jq+git once a second on idle — a deliberate battery trade the owner opted into
# for a live status line (a no-color terminal falls back to a static ●, needing no timer).
#
# Wire it (settings.json):
#   { "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "bash <THIS_PATH>" } }
#
# Requires bash 4+, jq. Optional git. Honours NO_COLOR / TERM=dumb.
