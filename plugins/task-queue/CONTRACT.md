# CONTRACT — what this plugin depends on

claude-task-queue is **read-only over Claude Code's own task store** and works by
reading a few of Claude Code's internal files and hook payloads. **None of these
are documented, stable APIs** — they are observed behaviour. This file records
exactly what we lean on so that, when something breaks after a Claude Code
update, you know where to look first.

> **Observed against:** Claude Code 2.x · last verified **2026-06-16**.
> If you re-verify on a newer version, bump that date.

All of this knowledge is centralized in [`lib/tasks.sh`](./lib/tasks.sh) and the
entrypoints in [`bin/`](./bin). If a dependency below changes, that is where
the fix goes — nothing else in the repo encodes these assumptions.

## The hard invariant

**We never write Claude Code's task store.** `~/.claude/tasks` belongs to the
model; the plugin only ever *reads* it or *injects context that nudges the
model*. It never calls `TaskUpdate` and never edits a task file.
This is the line that keeps the plugin from becoming a second, desyncing source
of truth — do not cross it. See the `never-mutate-native-store` design note.

## Dependencies

### 1. Native task store layout & schema

- **Path:** `~/.claude/tasks/<session-id>/<n>.json` (one file per task).
  Overridable in tests via `CLAUDE_TQ_TASKS_DIR`.
- **Fields read:** `id` (string), `subject`, `status`
  (`"pending" | "in_progress" | "completed"`), `blockedBy` (array of ids).
  We also use file **mtime** as a recency signal.
- **Used by:** the resume bridge (open tasks from prior sessions).
- **Lifecycle (observed 2026-05-30):** while a session's list has **any open
  task**, completed entries are **retained** on disk (status `completed`); the
  folder appears to be cleared only once the list is **fully drained**. So the
  store may hold a mix of `pending`/`in_progress`/`completed` files, or be empty.
  *(An earlier revision of this file claimed completed files are removed
  individually on completion — that was a misread of a fully-drained list, and
  is corrected here.)* The resume bridge is robust either way: it **selects only**
  `pending`/`in_progress`, so lingering completed entries never leak into carry-over.
- **If it changes:** carry-over silently stops. The plugin degrades to
  policy-only injection — it does not error out.

### 2. Transcript → repo mapping

- **Path:** `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`.
  Overridable via `CLAUDE_TQ_PROJECTS_DIR`.
- **Assumption:** a line near the **head** of that transcript carries a `cwd`
  field; we read it and resolve the **git repo root** (falling back to the cwd).
  This is how a task folder (keyed by session id) is scoped to a repo. Result is
  cached in `${CLAUDE_TQ_STATE_DIR}/root-cache.tsv` (a session's cwd is immutable).
- **If it changes:** sessions can't be mapped to repos, so cross-session resume
  stops surfacing tasks.

### 2b. Committed roadmap/backlog file (read-only, optional)

- **Path:** one of `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/BACKLOG.md`,
  `BACKLOG.md` at the repo root. Override via `CLAUDE_TQ_ROADMAP_FILE`.
- **Use:** on a fresh SessionStart, if present, the resume bridge adds a nudge to
  *hydrate the live task list* from the backlog's open items. We only check the
  file **exists** — we don't parse it; the model reads it. Detection is duplicated
  from the charter plugin on purpose (the install boundary keeps plugins
  self-contained — see AGENTS.md).
- **If it's absent:** no hydration nudge; everything else is unchanged.

### 2c. Policy marker in the Claude manual (read-only, optional)

- **Path:** `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `docs/CLAUDE.md` at the repo root,
  scanned for the literal token `claude-companion`.
- **Use:** on a fresh SessionStart, if present, the standing **policy** prose is
  replaced by a one-line re-anchor (bootstrap-once + drift-detect) — the manual
  is always loaded, so re-injecting it is a token tax. **State is never
  suppressed:** carryover, roadmap hydration, pause, and drift signals still
  fire. When absent, the full policy is injected with a one-line tip to record it
  and add the marker. The token is shared by convention with the other companion
  plugins (each detects it independently — install boundary).

### 3. `SessionStart` hook payload (stdin)

- **Fields read:** `session_id`, `cwd`, and `source` — `source` selects the full
  policy block (`startup`/`clear`/unknown) vs. a lean re-anchor
  (`compact`/`resume`). An unknown/missing source falls back to the full block.
- **Output contract:** we emit
  `{ "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "SessionStart", "additionalContext": "<text>" } }`
  — injected into the session context.

### 4. `UserPromptSubmit` hook payload (stdin)

- **Fields read:** `prompt` (the user's text) and `session_id`.
- **Behavior (`tq-capture.sh`):** runs on every prompt (local bash/jq checks — no
  model cost) but stays silent on trivial prompts. On a **multi-step OR
  consequential** prompt (`tq_looks_multistep` / `tq_looks_consequential` in
  `lib/capture.sh`) it injects the **interpret→present→approve review loop**
  instruction: (1) interpret the request in one line, (2) decompose into tasks,
  (3) judge each for risk/alignment and PARALLEL-vs-INLINE fan-out, (4) PRESENT
  understanding + per-task disposition + candid skip recommendations via
  AskUserQuestion, (5) `TaskCreate` **only approved** tasks. Consequential prompts
  get the same loop with extra "recommend against if warranted" scrutiny. It fires
  **regardless of existing queue state** (the old empty-queue gate and
  `tq_open_count` were removed). **Pause gates the review loop:** when the repo is
  paused (§ pause flag), the checkpoint is suppressed and substantive prompts run
  straight through in auto without presenting for approval. Disabled with
  `CLAUDE_TQ_CAPTURE_DISABLED`.
- **Intent of record (side effect):** on a substantive, non-paused prompt it also
  stashes the prompt text to `tq_intent_file($session_id)` (in the state dir) for the
  Stop gate below. Best-effort; gated off by `CLAUDE_TQ_INTENT_GATE=0`.
- **Output contract:** same shape, with `"hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit"`.
- **If it changes:** the loop instruction silently stops; capture still relies on
  the SessionStart policy.

### 4b. `Stop` hook payload (stdin) — the intent→outcome gate

- **Script:** `bin/tq-verify.sh`. **Fields read:** `cwd` (resolved to the repo
  root) and `session_id` (keys the stashed intent).
- **Behavior:** the close of the owner loop. On the first **dirty** Stop after a
  substantive ask was captured (§4), it replays the **intent of record** + a
  `git diff --stat` of what changed and blocks **once** (`decision: block`) so the
  model verifies the OUTCOME matches the ask and recaps in plain language —
  surfacing "wrong thing / only part / something extra" to the non-technical owner
  before "done". The intent is **consumed on fire**, so it can never loop; it's the
  outcome-time complement to §4's intent-time review.
- **Silent when:** no intent was captured (trivial/conversational turn), the tree is
  clean (work not done → intent kept for a later Stop), outside a git repo, or
  `CLAUDE_TQ_INTENT_GATE=0`. Best-effort — any internal error degrades to "allow the
  stop" (it re-asserts `set +e` after sourcing `lib/tasks.sh`, which enables `-e`).
- **If it changes:** the gate silently stops; the rest of the plugin is unaffected.

### 5. Hook wiring & env

- `hooks/hooks.json` wires all entrypoints; Claude Code expands
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (plugin dir) and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` (writable
  per-plugin state, used for the root cache).
- Requires **Bash 4+** and **`jq`** on PATH.

## How this is (and isn't) tested

The `bats` suite (`tests/tasks.bats`) **fakes** the layouts above via the
`CLAUDE_TQ_*` overrides. That fully exercises our *logic*, but by construction it
**cannot detect a change in Claude Code's real format** — those tests would stay
green while production silently broke.

The real boundary is therefore verified three other ways:

- **`tests/packaging.bats`** guards the shipped artifact (version sync, valid
  JSON, hook scripts exist) — see CI.
- **Schema-drift canary:** `tq_schema_status` (in `lib/tasks.sh`) samples real
  task files and confirms they still carry the `id`/`status` fields we read; its
  result is surfaced at SessionStart. This is the live-environment check that the
  fakes can't provide — heed it first when something stops working.
- **Manual end-to-end:** after `claude plugin update task-queue`, start a fresh
  session, leave a task open, end the session, and start a new session in the same
  repo — confirm the cross-session resume note re-surfaces the unfinished task.
  Run this whenever you bump the "observed against" version above.

## Where the plugin writes (never the task store)

A few small files, all outside `~/.claude/tasks`:

- **Root cache** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/root-cache.tsv` (session→repo mapping;
  in plugin data so it survives updates).
- **Intent of record** — `<state-dir>/intent-<session_id>` (the latest substantive
  prompt, written by `tq-capture.sh`, read+consumed by `tq-verify.sh`). Both hooks
  run with `CLAUDE_TQ_STATE_DIR=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`, so they share the path; not
  the task store.
- **Pause flags** — `~/.claude/state/task-queue/paused/<encoded-repo-root>`
  (overridable via `CLAUDE_TQ_PAUSE_DIR`). One empty file per paused repo; its
  presence is the pause, which **suppresses the interpret→present→approve review
  loop** so substantive prompts run straight through in auto. A fixed home so the
  `tq-capture.sh` hook and `bin/tq-pause.sh` (run by the model in plain bash) both
  resolve the identical path.
- **Agent-mode flags** — `~/.claude/state/task-queue/agent/<encoded-repo-root>`
  (overridable via `CLAUDE_TQ_AGENT_DIR`). Same scheme as pause: an empty file
  per repo where agent-mode is explicitly enabled. `bin/tq-agent.sh` writes it; the
  SessionStart hook reads it to decide whether to permit subagent fan-out.
  **Global default:** `CLAUDE_TQ_AGENT_MODE=on|1` (e.g. in settings.json `env`)
  turns agent-mode on everywhere without a per-repo flag — for users who prefer
  speed over token-thrift. Per-repo flag OR the env enables it; off otherwise.

If a dependency here drifts, prefer making the plugin **degrade quietly** (no
output) over guessing — a missing nudge is invisible; a wrong one is noise.
